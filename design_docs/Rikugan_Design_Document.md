## 1. Introduction and Goals

Rikugan is a web-based application designed to revolutionize project management through gamification and role-based task assignment. The system addresses the need for better organization and resource allocation in software development projects by implementing a bounty-based reward system.

### 1.1. Requirements Overview

**What is Rikugan?**

The main purpose of Rikugan is to provide a gamified project management platform that combines traditional Kanban board functionality with monetary incentives through a bounty system. The application is designed specifically for software development teams looking to increase productivity and engagement through structured reward mechanisms.

**Main Features:**
- **Role-based User Management**: Three distinct user roles (Goons, Hashira, Oyakatasama) with escalating privileges
- **Bounty-based Task System**: Tasks with monetary rewards to incentivize completion
- **Kanban Board Interface**: Visual task management with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant updates on task assignments, completions, and deadlines
- **License Management**: Controlled access through license-based authorization
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Performance metrics and progress tracking
- **Deadline Management**: Automated penalty system for missed deadlines

The application supports exactly three user roles with specific hierarchical relationships:
- **Goons (Junior Programmers)**: Can select tasks, update status, and view personal profile
- **Hashira (Senior Programmers)**: All Goon capabilities plus task creation and team monitoring
- **Oyakatasama (Administrators)**: Full system administration including user and license management

The system should handle an "unlimited" number of tasks but is designed with a focus on quality over quantity, encouraging meaningful task completion through the bounty system.

### 1.2. Quality Goals

## 3. System Scope and Context

This chapter describes the environment and context of Rikugan: who uses the system and on which other systems does Rikugan depend.

### 3.1. Business Context

![Business Context](Business_context.png)

**Goons (Junior Programmers)**
Entry-level developers who use Rikugan to find and complete programming tasks in exchange for monetary bounties. They interact with the system to browse available tasks, accept assignments, track progress, and manage their earnings.

**Hashira (Senior Programmers)**
Experienced developers who create and manage tasks, set bounty amounts, and monitor team progress. They have all the capabilities of Goons plus additional administrative functions for task and team management.

**Oyakatasama (System Administrators)**
System administrators responsible for user account management, license distribution, system configuration, and overall platform oversight. They have full access to all system functions.


### 3.2. Technical Context

![alt text](<out/Techical Context.png>)

Rikugan consists of three main technical components:

**Frontend (React Application)**
The client-side application runs in modern web browsers and communicates with the backend via REST API calls. Built with React 18+ and HeroUI components for a responsive, interactive user interface.

**Backend (Node.js Server)**
The server-side application provides RESTful API endpoints for all business logic, built with Express.js framework. Handles authentication, authorization, data validation, and business rule enforcement.

**Database (MySQL)**
Persistent data storage using MySQL 8.0+ with normalized relational schema for users, tasks, bounties, notifications, and licenses.

| Interface | Protocol | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Web UI | HTTPS | Browser-based user interface for all user interactions |
| API Communication | REST over HTTPS | JSON-based API for frontend-backend communication |
| Database Access | MySQL Protocol | Secure database connections with connection pooling |
| Development Tools | Docker | Containerized development and deployment environment |


## 4. Solution Strategy

At the core of Rikugan is a role-based hierarchy that governs access to different system functions, combined with a bounty-based incentive system that gamifies task completion.

The application is built using a modern web development stack that emphasizes maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity:

**Frontend Strategy:** React 18+ with functional components and hooks provides a component-based architecture that is easy to understand, test, and extend. HeroUI component library ensures consistent design and reduces development time.

**Backend Strategy:** Node.js with Express.js following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern provides a lightweight, fast server framework with clear separation of concerns. The MVC architecture ensures organized code structure with Models handling data logic, Controllers managing request/response flow, and Views (JSON responses) formatting output. RESTful API design enables potential future mobile applications.

**Data Strategy:** MySQL database with normalized schema design provides ACID compliance and reliable data persistence. Connection pooling and prepared statements ensure good performance and security.

**Security Strategy:** JWT-based authentication provides stateless, scalable session management. Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented at both API and component levels to ensure proper authorization.

**Deployment Strategy:** Docker containerization provides consistent deployment environments and simplifies development setup. Docker Compose orchestrates multi-container deployment.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Role-Based Architecture**: The three-tier user hierarchy (Goons → Hashira → Oyakatasama) is enforced throughout the system, from database constraints to UI component rendering.

2. **Bounty-First Design**: Tasks are always associated with monetary rewards, making the bounty system a core domain concept rather than an add-on feature.

3. **License-Controlled Access**: The system implements a license verification system that restricts functionality for unlicensed instances, adding a layer of access control.

4. **API-First Development**: The backend API is designed independently of the frontend, enabling potential future expansion to mobile or other client applications.

5. **Audit Trail**: All significant user actions are logged for compliance and debugging purposes.

## 5. Building Block View

The application is structured as a modern web application with clear separation between frontend presentation, backend business logic, and data persistence layers.

## 6. Runtime View

User interaction with Rikugan involves several key workflows that demonstrate the system's behavior during typical operations.

### 6.1. User Authentication Flow

![alt text](Auth.png)

### 6.2. User Registration Flow

![alt text](user_registration_flow.png)

**Registration Flow Key Points:**
- Only Oyakatasama (administrators) can create new user accounts
- Username and email uniqueness is enforced at the database level
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Role assignment (Goon, Hashira, Oyakatasama) is done during registration
- Optional email notification can be sent to new users with their login credentials
- No self-registration capability for security reasons
- License is team-based, not assigned per user

## 8. Concepts

### 8.1. Domain Models

Rikugan is built around a clear domain model that represents the core business entities and their relationships:

![alt text](domain_class_model.png)

**Core Domain Entities:**

| Entity | Description | Key Attributes |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Team** | Project teams with shared license | name, licenseKey, memberCount, createdAt |
| **User** | System users with role-based privileges | username, email, role (Goon/Hashira/Oyakatasama), balance, teamId |
| **Task** | Work items with bounty rewards | title, description, bountyAmount, deadline, status, priority, teamId |
| **Bounty** | Monetary rewards for task completion | amount, status (pending/paid/cancelled), paidAt |
| **License** | Team-based access control | licenseKey, teamId, status, expiryDate, maxUsers |
| **Notification** | System-generated user notifications | type, message, readStatus, timestamp |

**Important Business Methods:**

```typescript
class Team {
  hasValidLicense(): boolean
  canAddMember(): boolean
  getMemberCount(): number
  isLicenseExpired(): boolean
}

class User {
  canCreateTask(): boolean
  canAssignTask(): boolean  
  hasValidTeamLicense(): boolean
  calculateTotalEarnings(): number
  getTeam(): Team
}

class Task {
  isOverdue(): boolean
  canBeAssignedTo(user: User): boolean
  calculatePenalty(): number
  getTimeRemaining(): Duration
  belongsToTeam(teamId: number): boolean
}

class Bounty {
  process(): void
  calculateBonus(): number
  canBePaid(): boolean
}

class License {
  isValid(): boolean
  isExpired(): boolean
  canAccommodateUsers(count: number): boolean
}
```

### 8.2. Persistency

Rikugan uses MySQL 8.0+ for relational data storage with a normalized database schema designed for data integrity and query performance.

**Database Schema Design:**
```sql
-- Core Tables
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE licenses (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  team_id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  license_key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('active', 'expired', 'revoked') DEFAULT 'active',
  max_users INT DEFAULT 10,
  expiry_date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  team_id INT NOT NULL,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role ENUM('goon', 'hashira', 'oyakatasama') NOT NULL,
  balance DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  team_id INT NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  bounty_amount DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
  deadline DATETIME NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('available', 'in_progress', 'review', 'completed', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'available',
  priority ENUM('low', 'medium', 'high') DEFAULT 'medium',
  created_by INT NOT NULL,
  assigned_to INT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

**Data Access Patterns:**
- Connection pooling for optimal database performance
- Prepared statements for SQL injection prevention  
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Indexing on frequently queried columns (user roles, task status, deadlines)

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Automated daily backups of critical data
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Database migration scripts for schema versioning

### 8.3. User Interface

The Rikugan interface is built with React 18+ and HeroUI components, providing a modern, responsive web application that adapts to different screen sizes and user roles.

**Design Principles:**
- **Role-based UI**: Interface elements are conditionally rendered based on user permissions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level A compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized bundle sizes

**Component Architecture:**
```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/          # Generic components (Button, Modal, etc.)
│   ├── task/            # Task-specific components (TaskCard, TaskBoard)
│   └── user/            # User-specific components (UserProfile, UserList)
├── pages/               # Route-level components  
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx    # Role-specific dashboard
│   ├── TaskBoard.tsx    # Kanban task management
│   └── Login.tsx        # Authentication
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── services/            # API communication
└── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
```

**Theme and Styling:**
- CSS-in-JS with HeroUI theme system
- Dark/light mode support
- Purple and gold color palette
- Consistent spacing and typography scales

### 8.4. Security

Rikugan implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and ensure proper access control:

**Authentication:**
- JWT-based stateless authentication with configurable expiration
- bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds
- Secure password policies enforced client and server-side
- Session timeout and automatic logout functionality

**Authorization:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) at API endpoint level
- Component-level permission checks in frontend
- Database-level constraints for data integrity
- License-based system access control

**Data Protection:**
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection via content security policies
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications

**Security Headers:**
```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
    }
  }
}));
```

### 8.5. Session Handling

Rikugan uses stateless JWT-based session management for scalability and security:

**JWT Token Structure:**
```javascript
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "role": "hashira",
  "iat": 1634567890,
  "exp": 1634654290,
  "permissions": ["create_task", "assign_task", "view_analytics"]
}
```

**Session Features:**
- Token expiration after 8 hours of inactivity
- Refresh token mechanism for seamless user experience
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Role-based token content for efficient authorization checks

### 8.6. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling ensures system stability and provides meaningful feedback to users:

**Frontend Error Handling:**
```typescript
// Global error boundary for React component errors
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  handleError(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Application error:', error, errorInfo);
    // Report to error tracking service
  }
}

// API error handling with user-friendly messages
const handleApiError = (error: AxiosError) => {
  if (error.response?.status === 401) {
    // Redirect to login
    authService.logout();
  } else if (error.response?.status >= 500) {
    // Show generic error message
    showNotification('System error. Please try again later.');
  }
};
```

**Backend Error Handling:**
```javascript
// Global error handler middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Server error:', err);
  
  if (err.name === 'ValidationError') {
    res.status(400).json({
      error: {
        code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
        message: err.message,
        details: err.details
      }
    });
  } else {
    res.status(500).json({
      error: {
        code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
        message: 'An unexpected error occurred'
      }
    });
  }
});
```

### 8.7. Logging and Monitoring

Structured logging and monitoring provide visibility into system operations and performance:

**Logging Strategy:**
- Structured JSON logs for easier parsing and analysis
- Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error) for various environments
- Request/response logging for API calls
- Security event logging for audit trails

**Example Log Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-11-28T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "task-service",
  "userId": 123,
  "action": "task_created",
  "taskId": 456,
  "bountyAmount": 100,
  "duration": 45
}
```

### 8.8. Configuration

Environment-based configuration management supports different deployment scenarios:

**Configuration Structure:**
```javascript
// config/default.js
module.exports = {
  server: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
    host: process.env.HOST || 'localhost'
  },
  database: {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
    port: process.env.DB_PORT || 3306,
    name: process.env.DB_NAME || 'rikugan',
    pool: {
      min: 5,
      max: 20,
      acquireTimeoutMillis: 60000
    }
  },
  jwt: {
    secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'dev-secret',
    expiresIn: process.env.JWT_EXPIRES_IN || '8h'
  },
  bounty: {
    maxAmount: 1000,
    penaltyRate: 0.1,
    deadlineWarningHours: 24
  }
};
```

## 9. Design Decisions

### 9.1. Technology Stack Selection

**Problem:**
Choose appropriate technologies for a web-based project management application that balances learning objectives, development efficiency, and system requirements.

**Constraints:**
- Must use modern web technologies suitable for academic project
- Should provide good learning opportunities for students
- Must support role-based access control and real-time features
- Need to complete within one academic semester

**Considered Alternatives:**
1. **Frontend**: React vs Vue.js vs Angular
2. **Backend**: Node.js vs Python Flask vs Java Spring Boot
3. **Database**: MySQL vs PostgreSQL vs MongoDB

**Decision:**
Chose React + Node.js + MySQL stack because:
- **Full JavaScript Stack**: Enables students to focus on application logic rather than context switching between languages
- **React Ecosystem**: Large community, excellent documentation, and extensive learning resources
- **Express.js**: Lightweight, flexible, and well-suited for RESTful API development
- **MySQL**: Familiar relational database with excellent performance characteristics

### 9.2. Database Design

**Problem:**
Design a database schema that supports the bounty-based task management system with proper normalization, referential integrity, and query performance.

**Considered Alternatives:**
1. **Denormalized approach**: Store all task and user data in fewer tables for simplicity
2. **Over-normalized approach**: Separate every attribute into its own table
3. **Balanced normalization**: Third normal form with performance considerations

**Decision:**
Implemented a balanced approach (3NF) with strategic denormalization:
- **Users table**: Core user data with role enum for efficient querying
- **Tasks table**: Task details with foreign keys to users for creator and assignee
- **Bounties table**: Separate entity for tracking monetary transactions

**Benefits:**
- Data integrity through foreign key constraints
- Efficient queries for common operations (task listing, user lookup)
- Clear separation of concerns between entities
- Audit trail for financial transactions

### 9.3. Authentication Strategy

**Problem:**
Implement secure authentication that supports role-based access control while maintaining good user experience.

**Considered Alternatives:**
1. **Session-based authentication**: Server-side sessions with cookies
2. **JWT tokens**: Stateless tokens with client-side storage
3. **OAuth integration**: Third-party authentication providers

**Decision:**
Selected JWT-based authentication because:
- **Stateless**: Scales better and simplifies server deployment
- **Self-contained**: Tokens include user role and permissions for efficient authorization
- **Mobile-ready**: Easy to implement in future mobile applications
- **Learning value**: Students gain experience with modern authentication patterns

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// JWT payload includes role for efficient authorization
const token = jwt.sign({
  sub: user.id,
  role: user.role,
  permissions: getUserPermissions(user.role)
}, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '8h' });
```
