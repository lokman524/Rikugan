Safety Requirements
-------------------

**Data Protection:**
- Prevent data loss through regular automated backups
- Implement database transaction rollback capabilities
- Provide data validation to prevent corruption
- Maintain data integrity during concurrent operations

**User Safety Measures:**
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user information
- Implement session timeout to protect unattended sessions
- Provide clear confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (task deletion, account removal)
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent malicious code execution

Security Requirements
---------------------

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Implement secure password policies (minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements)
- Use industry-standard password hashing (bcrypt with salt)
- Implement JWT-based authentication with token expiration
- Enforce role-based access control for all system functions
- Provide secure logout functionality that invalidates tokens

**Data Security:**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (user credentials, personal information)
- Use HTTPS for all client-server communications
- Implement SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Validate and escape output data before rendering

**System Security:**
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Monitor and log security-relevant events
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

Software Quality Attributes
---------------------------

**Usability:**
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training for new users
- Consistent navigation and interaction patterns across all pages
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Responsive design supporting multiple screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level A standards

**Reliability:**
- System uptime of 95% during active development and testing phases
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Automatic error recovery for transient failures
- Data consistency maintained across all operations

**Maintainability:**
- Modular code structure following React best practices
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Standardized coding conventions with ESLint enforcement
- Unit test coverage of at least 70% for critical functions

**Portability:**
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Operating system independence through web-based deployment
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment environments
- Database abstraction to support potential MySQL alternatives

**Scalability:**
- Modular architecture supporting incremental feature additions
- Efficient database schema design for future growth
- Component-based frontend architecture for easy extension
- RESTful API design supporting future mobile applications

**Testability:**
- Unit testing capabilities for all major functions
- API endpoints designed for automated testing
- Test data generation and cleanup procedures
- Clear separation between business logic and UI components

Business Rules
--------------

**User Role Hierarchy:**
- Only Oyakatasama can create, modify, or delete user accounts
- Only Hashira and Oyakatasama can create new task bounties
- Only Goons and Hashira can select and work on tasks
- Users can only update status of tasks assigned to them
- Users cannot exceed their available balance when penalties are applied

**Task Management Rules:**
- Each task can only be assigned to one user at a time
- Task bounties must be positive monetary values
- Task deadlines must be future dates when created
- Completed tasks cannot be modified or reassigned
- Task status progression follows: Available → In Progress → Review → Completed

**Financial Rules:**
- Bounty payments are processed automatically upon task completion
- Deadline penalties are applied automatically when deadlines are missed
- Users cannot have negative account balances below -$100
- All financial transactions must be logged with timestamps
- Only administrators can manually adjust user account balances

**License and Access Rules:**
- All users must have valid licenses to access the system
- License validation occurs at every login attempt
- Expired licenses prevent system access until renewed
- Only Oyakatasama can issue, renew, or revoke licenses

**Notification Rules:**
- Task deadline reminders sent 24 hours before due date
- Assignment notifications sent immediately upon task selection
- Achievement notifications sent upon reaching milestones
- Administrative notifications have higher priority than user notifications
